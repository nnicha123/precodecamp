    <h3>Long Quote</h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.tolkien.co.uk/quotes-fellowship-ring/">
        <p>All that is gold does not glitter,
            Not all those who wander are lost;
            The old that is strong does not wither,
            Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

            From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
            A light from the shadows shall spring;
            Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
            The crownless again shall be king.</p>
