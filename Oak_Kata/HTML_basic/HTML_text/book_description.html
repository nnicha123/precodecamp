    <p>
        One book in particular that I would recommend kids in their teens to read would be
        <u>The Princess Diaries</u> by <u>Meg Cabot</u>. The series is highly <i><b>enjoyable</b></i>
        as it describes a <i><b>positive</b></i> young lady who's life is turned upside-down as she discovers
        her right as a Princess. The book was turned into 2 movies <u>The Princess Diaries</u>
        and <u>The Princess Diaries 2 : Royal Engagement</u>. Which are also highly rated.
